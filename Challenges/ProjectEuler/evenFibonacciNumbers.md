## Challenge
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed `n`, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

#### Example #1
Input: `fiboEvenSum(10)`

Expected Output: `10`

#### Example #2
Input: `fiboEvenSum(34)`

Expected Output: `44`

## Solutions

```js
// First Accepted Solution
function fiboEvenSum(n) {
  // Initial fibonacci sequence
  let fibb = [1, 2];
  // Total starts at either 2, if n is atleast 2, or 0
  let total = n > 1 ? 2 : 0;

  // Loops until the sequence reaches a number higher than n
  while (fibb[fibb.length - 1] <= n) {
    // Generates next number by adding the most recent 2 numbers
    let nextNum = fibb[fibb.length - 1] + fibb[fibb.length - 2];

    // If its even add it to the sum
    if (nextNum % 2 === 0) {
        total += nextNum;
    }

    // Adds the next number to the sequence
    fibb.push(nextNum);
  }

  return total;
}
```

```js
// Optimized Solution
function fiboEvenSum(n) {
    let currentNum = 2;
    let previousNum = 1;
    let total = 0;

    while (currentNum <= n) {
        // If the most recent number is even, add it to the total
        if (currentNum % 2 === 0) {
            total += currentNum;
        }

        // previousNum gets assigned the value of currentNum, and
        // currentNum gets assigned the sum of itself and the previousNum
        [previousNum, currentNum] = [currentNum, previousNum + currentNum];
    }
    
    return total;
}
```

```js
// Golfed Solution (73 chars)
fiboEvenSum = n => {
    c = 2
    l = 1
    t = 0

    while (c <= n) {
        if (c % 2 - 1) t += c;
        [l, c] = [c, l + c]
    }
    
    return t
}
```
